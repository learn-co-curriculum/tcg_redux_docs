# Redux Documentation

## Learning Goals

- Build familiarity with Redux's API
- Use Redux advanced features to solve common patterns in state management

## Introduction

### Pre-check

Before reading the Introduction, try to write down your answers to the following questions. As you read, see whether your answers match up to the documentation.

- Why do people use Redux? What problems does it solve?
- List the core concepts of redux. What role do each of them play?
- What are the principles of developing using Redux?

### Reading

Read the [Motivation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/motivation), [Core Concepts](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts), and [Three Principles](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles) sections from the Introduction. Together, they should take about 10 minutes.

### Post-check

After reading the introduction sections, answer the following questions.

- What surprised you as you were reading the docs? What was new to you?
- Revisit your pre-check answers. What changes you would make now that you have read the Introduction?

## Basic Tutorial

Follow the steps in the [Basic Tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial) to reproduce a TodoList app. This tutorial will take about 20 minutes to complete.

## Advanced Tutorial

Follow the steps in the [Advanced Tutorial](https://redux.js.org/advanced/advanced-tutorial) to build an app with async actions and middleware. This tutorial will take about 30 minutes. Be sure to get the code to run at each intermediate step. Get the Reddit API example running. Read through the working code, and see if you can explain each line. If there's a line that you don't understand, treat that like a bug. Use the tutorial, google, or another instructor to help make sure you have an understanding of what each line of code is doing.

## Recipes

There are a lot of links out to further reading about Redux. The Recipes are interesting to browse, because they present solutions to scenarios that developers frequently face.

From the Recipes, you should read [Configuring Your Store](https://redux.js.org/recipes/configuring-your-store), [Using the Object Spread Operator](https://redux.js.org/recipes/using-object-spread-operator), [Reducing Boilerplate](https://redux.js.org/recipes/reducing-boilerplate), [Writing Tests](https://redux.js.org/recipes/writing-tests), [Computing Derived Data](https://redux.js.org/recipes/computing-derived-data), [Implementing Undo History](https://redux.js.org/recipes/implementing-undo-history), and the 12 pages on [Structuring Reducers](https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/structuring-reducers). Read each of the recipes and run all of the code snippets in each one.

Reading and running the examples from all 18 Recipes pages will take about an hour.

## FAQ

The [Redux FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq) answers a ton of commonly asked questions about redux.

Read the 50 or so questions in the index. Before clicking through to the responses in the documentation, write down your best answer to all of the questions. Next, read the answers provided by the documentation. How well did your answers match up? Which areas are still confusing to you?

Answering the FAQ questions yourself, then reading and checking your answers against those in the documentation will take about an hour.
